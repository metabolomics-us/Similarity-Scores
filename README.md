# Similarity-Scores

### Similarity Score Graphs for Consensus Spectra
* Compute the similarity scores for consensus spectra with different reference spectrum

### Compute The Score
* Intensity consensus is a dictionary with bin number as the key, the value is a 2 dimensional array.
* Each row represents a consensus spectrum
* Used Cosine Similarity Method to compute the score 

### Similarity Score Graph
* Y-axis: Comparing consensus spectra vs different intensity values (different reference intensity values)
at the same time
* X-axis: Count of Consensus Spectra
